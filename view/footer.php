        The University of Southern Queensland acknowledges the First Nations of southern Queensland and their 
        ongoing connection to Country, lands, and waterways. Further, we recognise Aboriginal and Torres Strait 
        Islander peoples as the first educators and researchers of Australia. We pay deep respect to Elders past and present.
